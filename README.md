Microservice Calculator Testing with JUnit

This microservice is designed to test a calculator using JUnit testing. It includes several test cases to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the calculator's functionalities.

Features:

JUnit Testing: Utilizes JUnit, a popular testing framework for Java, to create and execute test cases.

Test Cases: Includes a set of test cases covering various scenarios to validate the calculator's operations.

Calculator Microservice: The microservice encapsulates the calculator logic and exposes methods for arithmetic operations.

Assertion Checks: Employs assertion checks to verify expected results against actual results in each test case.

Continuous Integration (CI): Integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment processes.

Technologies Used:
